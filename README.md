## Introduction

This project implements and compares several fundamental pathfinding algorithms in a 2D grid environment using Python. The task is to navigate from a designated start point to an endpoint on a grid where certain cells represent obstacles. The implemented algorithms are:

1. A Algorithm (A-Star)*
1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
1. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
